    "summary": "This video pitch presents AI Futures, a program designed to address the shortage of AI talent within the Department of Defense (DoD) by creating a pipeline of students from diverse backgrounds. AI Futures engages students through hands-on experiences and provides resources like mentorship and resume building to prepare them for national security careers. The program aims to broaden the talent pool by reaching students who may not traditionally consider government roles. Key results include engaging nearly 10,000 students and submitting over 200 resumes to DoD partners.",
